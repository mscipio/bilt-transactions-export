# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icon should represent the Bilt brand (blue/purple colors) or a generic export/download icon.

For development/testing, you can use placeholder images or download free icons from:
- [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)

Recommended: Use a simple export/download icon in blue (#1a237e) to match the extension UI.
